                <h4>Curtis J. Price | Eagle Creek, Oregon</h4>
                My name is Curtis Joseph Price. I was originally born in Salt Lake City, UT, but have since been moving more westward across Arizona, Nevada, Wyoming and ultimately living in Eagle Creek Oregon as my current residence, a small town just south of Portland. Currently do not possess an official job, but I do have some experience with some aspects of the restaurant and banquets industries in the past, like hosting and dish washing, and am actually currently aiding my parents with mobile home park management and maintenance due to living not too far at present.

                <h4>Oregon, USA</h4>
                Oregon has been home to many indigenous nations for thousands of years. The first European traders, explorers, and settlers began exploring what is now Oregon's Pacific coast in the early to mid-16th century. As early as 1564, the Spanish began sending vessels northeast from the Philippines, riding the Kuroshio Current in a sweeping circular route across the northern part of the Pacific. In 1592, Juan de Fuca undertook detailed mapping and studies of ocean currents in the Pacific Northwest, including the Oregon coast as well as the strait now bearing his name. The Lewis and Clark Expedition traversed Oregon in the early 1800s, and the first permanent European settlements in Oregon were established by fur trappers and traders. In 1843, an autonomous government was formed in the Oregon Country, and the Oregon Territory was created in 1848. Oregon became the 33rd state of the U.S. on February 14, 1859. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon">Wikipedia.org</a>
